        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This study shows, through stimulation of single GCs and recordings of their CA3 targets in anaesthetized rats, that high-frequency GC activity recruits pyramidal cell firing"

        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This study, using juxtacellular recordings in freely moving rats, shows that permanent place fields in GCs can be induced by strong depolarization that would be suitable to trigger dendritic depolarization"

        "reason": "This study, using in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulations, shows that a subpopulation of MEC layer II neurons forms salient and distinct representations of different spatial contexts which are necessary for CFC learning"
