        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This study reveals that memory B cells and longlived plasma cells are produced in different phases of the GC reaction, with memory B cell formation preceding the formation of plasma cells"

        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This study shows that owing to their high affinity and ability to be activated in the presence of neutralizing antibodies, isotype-switched IgG-expressing memory B cells prevail during the early phase of immune memory; however, once they disappear due to a shorter life span"
