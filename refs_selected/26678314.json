        "selected": true,
        "reason": "References 53 and 54 show that p53 phosphorylated at Ser15 and Ser20 displays different roles in auto-regulation and cell cycle checkpoint activation"

        "selected": true,
        "reason": "The authors demonstrated that the shelterin protein TRF2 prevents the completion of DSB repair by NHEJ in telomeres by inhibiting ligase IV, thereby causing persistent ATM-mediated DDR signalling"

        "reason": "References 117, 119 and 120 describe the fundamental role of PARP1 for survival and regulation of autophagy following DNA damage"
