        "selected": true,
        "reason": "References 35 and 36 use deep-sequencing analyses of neurexin mRNAs to identify a novel splice site in neurexin, to generate a quantitative description of neurexin isoform diversity in the brain and to demonstrate that neurexin diversity is linked to cellular diversity"

        "title": "Neuroligin Expressed in Nonneuronal Cells Triggers Presynaptic Development in Contacting Axons",
        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This classic study demonstrates that expression of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin on the surface of non-neuronal cells induces presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons of co-cultured neurons, a finding that contributed to the subsequent identification and characterization of additional synaptic adhesion molecules"

        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This study profiles mRNAs isolated from single cells and finds cell type-specific expression of neurexin isoforms and neurexin ligands, supporting the existence of cell type-specific adhesion repertoires"

        "title": "Protocadherins mediate dendritic self-avoidance in the mammalian nervous system",
        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This study shows that deletion of the \u03b3-protocadherin cluster in retinal SACs and cerebellar Purkinje cells disrupts self-avoidance of their dendrites, indicating that protocadherin diversity provides these cell types with distinct surface identities required for proper establishment of their dendritic arbors"

        "title": "Type II Cadherins Guide Assembly of a Direction-Selective Retinal Circuit",
        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This article shows that the type II cadherins CDH8 and CDH9 are selectively expressed in distinct retinal cell types and instruct the targeting of the axons of these cells to specific sublaminae in the IPL of the mouse retina in vivo"

        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This article shows that combinations of Ig superfamily proteins expressed on GABApre axons heterophilically interact with Ig superfamily proteins expressed on proprioceptive sensory axon terminals to promote the strikingly specific accumulation of GABApre synapses on"
