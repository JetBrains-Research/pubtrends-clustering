        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This study demonstrates a new mode of regulation of glycolytic flux by PI3K through an AKT-independent, RAC-dependent mechanism involving cytoskeletal remodelling and release of actin"

        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This study demonstrates that treatment with antioxidants or activation of oncogenes such as ERBB2, PIK3CA or AKT can rescue ROS-induced cell death caused by detachment of mammary cells from the extracellular matrix"
