        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This study compared the transcriptome of reactive astrocytes in a model of ischaemia and a model of neuroinflammation, and found that astrocytes display injury-specific induction of gene expression"

        "title": "Astrocyte-encoded positional cues maintain sensorimotor circuit integrity",
        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This study showed that astrocytes from the dorsal and ventral spinal cord display marked transcriptomic differences. Conditional ablation of a ventrally enriched astrocyte gene, Sema3a, which encodes an axon guidance molecule, results in a region-specific phenotype of motor neurons"

        "title": "Circuit-specific signaling in astrocyte-neuron networks in basal ganglia pathways",
        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This important study investigated how astrocytes modulate synaptic transmission in specific basal ganglia circuits and found that striatal astrocytes differentially regulate neuronal activity in a circuit-and synapse-specific manner"

        "title": "Optogenetic astrocyte activation modulates response selectivity of visual cortex neurons in vivo",
        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This study showed that photoactivation of astrocytes in the mouse primary visual cortex selectively modulates the activity of interneuron subtypes"

        "title": "Bergmann Glial AMPA Receptors Are Required for Fine Motor Coordination",
        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This work showed that AMPAR signalling in Bergmann glial cells is necessary for Purkinje cell activity and fine motor coordination at the behavioural level"

        "title": "An astrocyte-dependent mechanism for neuronal rhythmogenesis",
        "selected": true,
        "reason": "This study showed that astrocytes respond to sensory stimulation in a central pattern-generator region and are able to modulate neuronal activity by altering local extracellular Ca 2+ concentration"
